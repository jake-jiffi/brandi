| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | The closest Material surface is a tooltip, Compose `RichTooltip` or `PlainTooltip` in a `TooltipBox` [AND-9]. Material tooltips display brief labels or messages [MAT-4]. The info button is a Compose `IconButton` [AND-1]. |
| Target and spacing | The info button keeps the 48 dp minimum [AND-1]. |
| Type | Roboto is the default for both the brand and the plain typeface [MAT-16]. Text in sp, scaled nonlinearly up to 200% since Android 14 [AND-5]. |
| Colour and theme | One set of colour roles serves light and dark [MAT-18]. Medium contrast (3:1) and high contrast (7:1) arrive through the same roles [MAT-18]. Text keeps 4.5:1 below 18 sp, or below 14 sp in bold, and 3:1 otherwise [AND-1]. |
| States | Open or closed. The info button takes focused, hovered and pressed states [MAT-9]. |
| Motion | Material motion runs on springs, in an expressive or a standard scheme [MAT-17]. People can turn on Remove animations [AND-10]. `ValueAnimator.areAnimatorsEnabled()` returns false when the animator duration scale is 0 or Battery Saver is on [AND-6]. Whether Remove animations sets that scale is not confirmed. |
| Accessibility API | The info button is `Role.Button`, named for what it explains [AND-1]. When it opens, its text is read through a polite live region [AND-2]. |
| Navigation placement | Beside the label or figure it explains, inside the window, as Compose clamps tooltips to the window bounds [AND-9]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | A press, a tap or Enter opens it, and Escape or a press elsewhere closes it, by the product's rule. How a Compose tooltip opens from a tap, and whether Escape closes it, is not confirmed. Focus ring 3 dp thick, 2 dp outside, in `secondary` [MAT-5]. |
| Haptics | None. On Android less is more with haptics, and no haptic beats a buzzy one [AND-3]. |
| Brand may change | Hover shows it after a short delay (150 ms in the reference). A press, a tap or Enter opens it and reads it out. MetricCard's hint is the proven case, and as its own component it is unproven. Material has no toggletip component [MAT-4]. |
| Platform owns | Clamping to the window bounds [AND-9]. How TalkBack merges nodes and phrases them [AND-2]. |
| Not confirmed | Motion: whether Remove animations sets the animator duration scale that `areAnimatorsEnabled()` reads. Keyboard, pointer, trackpad: how a Compose tooltip opens from a tap, and whether Escape closes it. |
