| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | Material menus [MAT-4]: Compose `DropdownMenu`, with `SelectableDropdownMenuItem` for the current choice [AND-9], and a bottom sheet at compact widths [MAT-10]. |
| Target and spacing | The account button and each workspace keep at least 48 × 48 dp [MAT-7]. |
| Type | Roboto is the default for both the brand and the plain typeface [MAT-16]. Text in sp, scaled nonlinearly up to 200% since Android 14 [AND-5]. |
| Colour and theme | One set of colour roles serves light and dark [MAT-18]. Medium contrast (3:1) and high contrast (7:1) arrive through the same roles [MAT-18]. Text keeps 4.5:1 below 18 sp, or below 14 sp in bold, and 3:1 otherwise [AND-1]. The current workspace shows a check as well as colour, as Material asks of selectable lists [MAT-21]. |
| States | The current workspace is selected, by the product's rule. Menu items take Material's states [MAT-9]. |
| Motion | Material motion runs on springs, in an expressive or a standard scheme [MAT-17]. People can turn on Remove animations [AND-10]. `ValueAnimator.areAnimatorsEnabled()` returns false when the animator duration scale is 0 or Battery Saver is on [AND-6]. Whether Remove animations sets that scale is not confirmed. |
| Accessibility API | The account button is named "[name], [role], account menu" [AND-1]. After switching, the product says where the person is now, through a polite live region [AND-2]. |
| Navigation placement | Off the account button on the rail, by the product's rule. At compact widths Material uses a bottom sheet for supplementary selection [MAT-10]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | The product's menu map applies: arrows, Enter, and Escape back to the trigger. The key map a Compose `DropdownMenu` supports is not confirmed. Keyboard focus shows Material's ring-like focus indicator [MAT-9]. |
| Haptics | None. On Android less is more with haptics, and no haptic beats a buzzy one [AND-3]. |
| Brand may change | The current workspace shows on every screen, and switching says where the person is now. Unproven: no review round has checked it. The product's typefaces replace Roboto [MAT-16]. |
| Platform owns | How TalkBack merges nodes and phrases them [AND-2]. |
| Not confirmed | Motion: whether Remove animations sets the animator duration scale that `areAnimatorsEnabled()` reads. Keyboard, pointer, trackpad: the key map a Compose `DropdownMenu` supports. |
