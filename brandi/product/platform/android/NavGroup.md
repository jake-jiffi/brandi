| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | None as a separate Material component [MAT-4]. Material groups related destinations together [MAT-13]. A section header API on Compose's `WideNavigationRail` is not confirmed. |
| Target and spacing | A collapsible header keeps at least 48 × 48 dp [MAT-7]. |
| Type | Roboto is the default for both the brand and the plain typeface [MAT-16]. Text in sp, scaled nonlinearly up to 200% since Android 14 [AND-5]. The label is short and uppercase, by the product's rule. |
| Colour and theme | One set of colour roles serves light and dark [MAT-18]. Medium contrast (3:1) and high contrast (7:1) arrive through the same roles [MAT-18]. Text keeps 4.5:1 below 18 sp, or below 14 sp in bold, and 3:1 otherwise [AND-1]. |
| States | Open or closed when collapsible, by the product's rule. A collapsible header takes focused, hovered and pressed states [MAT-9]. |
| Motion | Material motion runs on springs, in an expressive or a standard scheme [MAT-17]. People can turn on Remove animations [AND-10]. `ValueAnimator.areAnimatorsEnabled()` returns false when the animator duration scale is 0 or Battery Saver is on [AND-6]. Whether Remove animations sets that scale is not confirmed. |
| Accessibility API | The label takes `heading()` so TalkBack can jump between groups [AND-2]. A collapsible header is `Role.Button` [AND-1], with its open or closed state through `stateDescription` [AND-2]. |
| Navigation placement | On the rail, related destinations together and the most frequent at the top [MAT-13]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | A collapsible header takes Tab, then Space or Enter, as a button [MAT-6]. Keyboard focus shows Material's ring-like focus indicator [MAT-9]. |
| Haptics | None. On Android less is more with haptics, and no haptic beats a buzzy one [AND-3]. |
| Brand may change | `label`, `collapsible` and `defaultOpen`, with short uppercase labels and eight top-level items at most across the groups. Material's rail holds 3 to 7 destinations [MAT-12]. |
| Platform owns | How TalkBack merges nodes and phrases them [AND-2]. |
| Not confirmed | Native control: a section header API on Compose's `WideNavigationRail`. Motion: whether Remove animations sets the animator duration scale that `areAnimatorsEnabled()` reads. |
