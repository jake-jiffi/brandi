| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | None named in the registry. The closest pattern is a list [APL-14]. |
| Target and spacing | Nothing here is pressed, so no hit area applies. Any control inside meets the 44 × 44 pt default and the 28 × 28 pt minimum [APL-1]. |
| Type | SF Pro through a text style, so it follows Dynamic Type [APL-3]. At large sizes, stack secondary items under the text instead of truncating [APL-3]. |
| Colour and theme | Icons by kind come with words, never colour alone [APL-1]. One colour never means two things [APL-4]. Every custom colour needs light and dark variants, each with an increased-contrast option [APL-4]. |
| States | None of its own. Each line is static text [APL-23]. |
| Motion | It has no motion of its own. Anything that animates near it follows Reduce Motion [APL-1] [APL-24]. |
| Accessibility API | VoiceOver reads each line as one element: who did what, and when [APL-19]. The icons are decoration [APL-19]. |
| Navigation placement | On a record, often in the detail column of a split view [APL-10]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | Not a focus target. iPadOS keyboard focus covers content elements such as list items, text fields and search fields, and Full Keyboard Access covers controls [APL-15] [APL-16]. |
| Haptics | None specified for timelines. Apple names system haptics for toggles, sliders and pickers, and feedback generators for notification, impact and selection [APL-18]. |
| Brand may change | The icons by kind and the time format. Each line names who did what. The assistant's actions use the `ai` tone, a colour kept for that one meaning [APL-4]. |
| Platform owns | VoiceOver's reading order [APL-19]. |
| Not confirmed | Relative and absolute time formats on iOS: no registry page covers them. |
