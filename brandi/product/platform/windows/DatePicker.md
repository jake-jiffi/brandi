| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | WinUI `DatePicker`, where Enter opens the picker UI and also commits and closes it [WIN-17]. A calendar-style picker: not confirmed in the registry. |
| Target and spacing | Touch target 7.5 mm, which is 40 × 40 px at 135 PPI and 1.0x scale [WIN-2]. 8 epx to its header [WIN-4]. |
| Type | Segoe UI Variable, Body 14 on 20 epx [WIN-5] [FLU-3]. Text scales from 100% to 225%, and WinUI text controls follow it by default [WIN-6]. |
| Colour and theme | Theme brushes [WIN-8]. In contrast themes the field takes the `SystemColorButtonFaceColor` pair, and the chosen date the highlight pair [WIN-9]. |
| States | Empty, set, picker open and disabled. Disabled leaves the tab order [WIN-18]. Invalid styling: not confirmed. |
| Motion | Use WinUI's built-in control motion and avoid custom animation [WIN-10]. Check `UISettings.AnimationsEnabled`, which reports whether animations are on [WIN-11]. |
| Accessibility API | Narrator through UI Automation. Name from the label through `AutomationProperties.LabeledBy` [WIN-19]. Its control type and value exposure: not confirmed. |
| Navigation placement | Forms and filters, with the header above at 8 epx [WIN-4]. The picker is transient UI over the page [WIN-17]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | Enter opens the picker and commits [WIN-17]. Esc cancels it [WIN-17]. |
| Haptics | None specified. WinUI 3 apps can use OS touchpad and mouse haptics through `Windows.Devices.Haptics` from Windows App SDK 2.4.0, where the OS and hardware support them [WIN-25]. When to play one: not confirmed. |
| Brand may change | Typing a date always works, in the product's date format. Arrows move by day and Page Up and Page Down by month, and durations use the `hours` style. Those keys are the product's own, since the registry gives `DatePicker` only Enter and Esc [WIN-17]. |
| Platform owns | The picker's open and commit keys [WIN-17]. |
| Not confirmed | Typing a date into `DatePicker`. A calendar picker and its keys. Value exposure. Invalid styling. Haptic guidance. |
