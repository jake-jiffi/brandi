| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | WinUI `ToggleButton`, a button that is either on or off [WIN-13]. |
| Target and spacing | Touch target 7.5 mm, which is 40 × 40 px at 135 PPI and 1.0x scale [WIN-2]. 8 epx between buttons [WIN-4]. Sizes, margins and positions in multiples of 4 epx [WIN-16]. |
| Type | Segoe UI Variable, Body 14 on 20 epx [WIN-5] [FLU-3]. Sentence case for all UI text [WIN-5]. Text scales from 100% to 225%, and WinUI text controls follow it by default [WIN-6]. |
| Colour and theme | Accent shows the state of an interactive control [WIN-7]. In contrast themes, on takes `SystemColorHighlightColor` with `SystemColorHighlightTextColor` and off the `SystemColorButtonFaceColor` pair [WIN-9]. Corners 4 px by default [WIN-12]. |
| States | On and off [WIN-13], plus pointer over, pressed and disabled. Disabled leaves the tab order [WIN-18]. Keyboard focus draws a 2 px outer and 1 px inner border, 1 px outside the control [WIN-3]. |
| Motion | Use WinUI's built-in control motion and avoid custom animation [WIN-10]. Check `UISettings.AnimationsEnabled`, which reports whether animations are on [WIN-11]. |
| Accessibility API | Narrator through UI Automation. Control type Button with the Toggle pattern and its state-change event, never Invoke as well [WIN-20]. Name from the visible text, with the count in words [WIN-19]. |
| Navigation placement | One row above the list or table it filters. The row is a related group, so arrow keys can move along it [WIN-17]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | Space invokes, and Enter activates `ToggleButton` like any command control [WIN-17]. `XYFocusKeyboardNavigation` adds arrow keys along the row [WIN-17]. |
| Haptics | None specified. WinUI 3 apps can use OS touchpad and mouse haptics through `Windows.Devices.Haptics` from Windows App SDK 2.4.0, where the OS and hardware support them [WIN-25]. When to play one: not confirmed. |
| Brand may change | On takes `selected-strong` and a check. The count is how many items match once applied, and only "needs you" counts take the highlight, read as "12 need you". The pressable shape departs from the 4 px `ControlCornerRadius` default [WIN-12], and the product's guidelines apply (2.3). |
| Platform owns | The Toggle pattern and what it means [WIN-20]. Contrast theme colours [WIN-9]. |
| Not confirmed | `ToggleButton`'s theme resource names for its on states. What built-in controls change when animations are off. Haptic guidance. |
