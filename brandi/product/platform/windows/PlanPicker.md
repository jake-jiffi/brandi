| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | A `GridView` in single selection, Microsoft's control for galleries such as products [WIN-22], or `RadioButtons` styled as cards [WIN-17]. |
| Target and spacing | Each card takes at least the 40 × 40 px touch target [WIN-2]. 12 epx between content areas [WIN-4]. |
| Type | The plan name in Subtitle, the price in Title, and inclusions in Body [WIN-5] [FLU-3]. |
| Colour and theme | Accent marks the chosen plan [WIN-7]. In contrast themes the chosen card takes the highlight pair [WIN-9]. |
| States | Chosen, not chosen, pointer over, pressed and disabled, with `SelectionMode` Single [WIN-22]. |
| Motion | Use WinUI's built-in control motion and avoid custom animation [WIN-10]. Check `UISettings.AnimationsEnabled`, which reports whether animations are on [WIN-11]. |
| Accessibility API | Narrator through UI Automation. Each card is named by plan and price [WIN-19], as an item that can be selected [WIN-21]. |
| Navigation placement | Sign-up and billing pages, in NavigationView's content area [WIN-15]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | In a multi-column grid all four arrow keys move [WIN-17], and Space selects the focused card [WIN-22]. As `RadioButtons`, one tab stop with arrows, Home and End [WIN-17]. |
| Haptics | None specified. WinUI 3 apps can use OS touchpad and mouse haptics through `Windows.Devices.Haptics` from Windows App SDK 2.4.0, where the OS and hardware support them [WIN-25]. When to play one: not confirmed. |
| Brand may change | Two to five plans side by side, the safest preselected, prices in the `currency` style, and more than five as a Select. Microsoft's gallery control fits the side-by-side layout [WIN-22]. |
| Platform owns | The selection model [WIN-22]. |
| Not confirmed | Card-styled radio groups. Haptic guidance. |
