| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Native control | The password control is not confirmed, since no registry page names one. A one-time code is a `TextBox` [WIN-19]. Show and hide is a `ToggleButton` [WIN-13]. |
| Target and spacing | Touch target 7.5 mm, which is 40 × 40 px at 135 PPI and 1.0x scale [WIN-2]. 8 epx to each header [WIN-4]. |
| Type | Segoe UI Variable, Body 14 on 20 epx [WIN-5] [FLU-3]. Text scales from 100% to 225%, and WinUI text controls follow it by default [WIN-6]. |
| Colour and theme | Theme brushes [WIN-8]. In contrast themes, the `SystemColorButtonFaceColor` pair [WIN-9]. |
| States | Password hidden or shown, invalid and disabled. Errors sit inline, never in a dialog, and Microsoft's own example is a password field [WIN-14]. |
| Motion | None of its own. Built-in control motion only [WIN-10]. |
| Accessibility API | Narrator through UI Automation. Names from labels through `AutomationProperties.LabeledBy` [WIN-19]. The show and hide toggle takes the Toggle pattern [WIN-20] and a name for what it does [WIN-19]. How a split code reads as one field: not confirmed. |
| Navigation placement | Sign-in and account forms, with headers above at 8 epx [WIN-4]. |
| Keyboard, pointer, trackpad | Keyboard input goes to text entry first [WIN-17]. Ctrl+V pastes [WIN-17], and paste is never blocked. The touch keyboard opens when the person focuses the field [WIN-17]. |
| Haptics | None specified. WinUI 3 apps can use OS touchpad and mouse haptics through `Windows.Devices.Haptics` from Windows App SDK 2.4.0, where the OS and hardware support them [WIN-25]. When to play one: not confirmed. |
| Brand may change | The right autofill hints, a toggle named for what it does, errors that say what is wrong and how to fix it, paste never blocked, and a code that pastes into every box at once. Microsoft also keeps validation errors inline [WIN-14]. |
| Platform owns | The touch keyboard [WIN-17]. |
| Not confirmed | The native password control and its reveal behaviour. Autofill and one-time code hints on Windows. How a split code reads as one field. Haptic guidance. |
